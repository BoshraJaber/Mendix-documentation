# Mendix Native Fonts
## Everything I Learned about Working with Mendix Native Fonts:

1. **Setting Up fonts:**
   - Unlike web fonts, native fonts has to be added during the build of the application. Fonts classes will be provided by Mendix Builder
   - This [documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/howto8/mobile/native-custom-fonts/) gives detailed steps on how to do so.

2. **Responsive fonts:**
   - Using the same font across all devices may not always be the best choice. Fortunately, Mendix offers a built-in helper function, `adjustFont`, which allows font adjustment based on the width and height of the device used. This function is typically found in the `theme\styles\native\core\helpers\_functions\adjustfont.js` folder.
. One option would be calling this function whenever using `fontSize` property.

   - In cases where the built-in function doesn't meet your requirements, consider the following solutions:
        1. Utilize the built-in method provided by React Native.
        2. Develop a custom function that offers greater flexibility and control. The recommended approach involves selecting a base device where the fonts appear as desired, then the fonts will scale down for smaller devices, and up for larger ones. An Example of that:
```js
import { PixelRatio } from "react-native";

export function adjustFontsReactNativeWay(size) {
  return size / PixelRatio.getFontScale()
}
```
or
```js
export function adjustFontsCustom(size) {
  // Use iPhone11 as base size which is 414 x 896
// base device recommended to be the one used in figma
  const baseWidth = 414;
  const baseHeight = 896;
  const scaleWidth = width / baseWidth;
  const scaleHeight = height / baseHeight;
  const scale = Math.min(scaleWidth, scaleHeight);
  return Math.ceil((size * scale));
}
```

3. **Common issues with fonts:**
- Classes genertated by Mendix is not usable, the way to solve it is to choose differnt fonts file. An example of the classes generated by Mendix might look like this:
```js
export const nexaBoldFontFamily = {
    â˜ž: "Nexa-Bold",
};
```
- Fonts used in the app can be affected by the device's default fonts, leading to various UI issues if not handled. However, this can be resolved by adding the following lines:

```js
import { Text } from "react-native";

Text.defaultProps = Text.defaultProps || {};
Text.defaultProps.allowFontScaling = false;
```
