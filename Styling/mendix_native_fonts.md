# Mendix Native Fonts
## Everything I Learned about Working with Mendix Native Fonts:

1. **Setting Up fonts:**
   - Unlike web fonts, native fonts has to be added during the build of the application. Fonts classes will be provided by Mendix Builder
   - This [documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/howto8/mobile/native-custom-fonts/) gives detailed steps on how to do so.

2. **Responsive fonts:**
   - Using the same font across all devices may not always be the best choice. Fortunately, Mendix offers a built-in helper function, adjustFont, which allows font adjustment based on the width and height of the device used. This function is typically found in the `theme\styles\native\core\helpers\_functions\adjustfont.js` folder.
. One option would be calling this function whenever using `fontSize` property.

  - In cases where the built-in function doesn't meet your requirements, consider the following solutions:
        1. Utilize the built-in method provided by React Native.
        2. Develop a custom function that offers greater flexibility and control. The recommended approach involves selecting a base device where the fonts appear as desired.
Then the fonts will scale down for smaller devices, and up for larger ones. An Example of that:
```js
import { PixelRatio } from "react-native";

export function adjustFontsReactNativeWay(size) {
  return size / PixelRatio.getFontScale()
}
```
or
```js
export function adjustFontsCustom(size) {
  // Use iPhone11 as base size which is 414 x 896
// base device recommended to be the one used in figma
  const baseWidth = 414;
  const baseHeight = 896;
  const scaleWidth = width / baseWidth;
  const scaleHeight = height / baseHeight;
  const scale = Math.min(scaleWidth, scaleHeight);
  return Math.ceil((size * scale));
}
```

3. **Common issues with fonts:**
- Classes genertated by Mendix is not usable, the way to solve it is to choose differnt fonts file. An example of the classes generated by Mendix might look like this:
```js
export const nexaBoldFontFamily = {
    ☞: "Nexa-Bold",
};
```
- Fonts used in the app can be affected by the device's default fonts, leading to various UI issues. However, this can be resolved by adding the following lines:

```js
import { Text } from "react-native";

Text.defaultProps = Text.defaultProps || {};
Text.defaultProps.allowFontScaling = false;
```
